Research Interests
======
**I am interested in a secure and efficient architecture of high-performance devices (such as GPU, NPU, CXL, and PIM).**

My research objective is to design high-performance devices with security guarantees.
To achieve this goal, my recent studies focus on 1) *hardware security* and 2) *performance improvement* of high-performance devices.

***Hardware Security of High-performance Devices*** **:**
As accelerators, CXL, and PIM are widely used in mission-critical tasks, the importance of security gets larger.
Although I extended Trusted Execution Environment to GPU, NPU, and CXL in previous works, countless security weaknesses still remain.
Therefore, I aim to increase the security level to resist unintended operations.

***Performance Improvement of High-performance Devices*** **:**
Since machine learning requires speedy processing, the performance improvement of high-performance devices is crucial.
Hence, I consider both hardware and software to enhance parallelism or cut down unnecessary procedures.
In a recent publication, I proposed the fine-grained scheduling algorithm in GPU by leveraging Multi-Process Service.
I set the further reduction of the execution time as a future research direction.

From these two sub-goals, I target combining a trusted system with a high-performance device design.
It is expected to protect users from accidents (caused by attackers or extreme environments) within a reasonable latency.
