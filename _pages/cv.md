Research Interests
======
**I am interested in the architecture of accelerators dedicated to machine learning.**

Since machine learning requires fast and secure processing, my research objective is to design high-performance accelerators with security guarantees.
To achieve this goal, my recent studies proposed architectures to support efficient hardware-based protection for accelerators.
In these works, I focus on security solutions that leverage characteristics of machine learning.
