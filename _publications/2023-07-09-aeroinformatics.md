In this research, aerospace-informatics was proposed by design of ramjet inlet using machine learning. The model was organized in three steps. First, the maximum combustion chamber pressure and air mass flow rate error according to the shape was predicted. Second, the shape was discriminated whether it is feasible or not. Third, the shape with the high maximum combustion chamber pressure, the low air mass flow rate error, and the high feasibility was recommended. As a result, our proposed mechanism correctly predicted the pressure and the mass flow rate error, and sorted the ramjet design except crossing two less-important designs.
