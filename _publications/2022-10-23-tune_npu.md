One of the key security supports for neural processing units (NPUs) is the hardware-based memory protection to provide confidentiality and integrity of NPU data. However, adopting the memory encryption and integrity protection techniques developed for CPUs do not fully utilize the NPU characteristics, incurring a significant performance degradation. To address the performance challenges, this paper proposes new improvements of memory protection for NPUs based on the unique property of NPU computation. The design first proposes a context-based memory protection which imposes the hardware memory protection only for the critical memory region of NPUs. Second, it allows adjusting the counter granularity for NPU memory to reduce the overheads of common counter-mode encryption. In addition, it exploits the read-only property of machine learning parameters, and adds a trusted communication channel between the CPU and NPU. Our evaluation with a simulated NPU shows that the performance overhead of memory protection for NPUs can be significantly reduced from the state-of-the-art CPU-oriented design, improving the performance by 13.5%.
